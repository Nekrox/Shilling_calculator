# Shilling_calculator

As a R.A I am responsible for gathering and manipulation of the Dublin Stock Exchange data which is spanned over two centuries. It involves both adding new data and merging existing data sets. Sometimes the data has to be entered manually, and that is why I have implemented a Shilling calculator, which uses user input in a format shilling / penny. It automatically saves the result in the clipboard, which helps to automate the process of data entering and improves both efficiency and accuracy of the entered data.
 
This app is based on the Tkinter module, so if you would like to use it, you will need to import it in your local Python IDE.
